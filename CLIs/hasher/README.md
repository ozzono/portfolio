# Hasher - *Code Technical Practice*

## Table of contents

- [Hash function](#hash-function)
- [Run the code](#run-the-code)
- [Test sample](#test-sample)

## Hash function

As I did not understand what was meant to be done as hash function, I implemented what I got out of the [description](./DESCRIPTION.md#L18) as nearly as possible.
> Note: by default `make` commands runs only on unix systems.

## Run the code

I compiled a binary so it can be used in any system and without requiring golang to be installed.  
Execute `./hasher -h` or `make help` for more execution instructions.

## Test sample

The test sample was executed using [this config file](/samples/config_sample-1.json).
> Note: [cmd/samples](cmd/samples) is a symbolic link to [/samples](/samples)
