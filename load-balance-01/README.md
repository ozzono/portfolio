# Load Balance

Challenge [description here](./customer_success_balancing/README.md)

* The code was adapted to Go from the original one in Ruby;
* I used the same data set to apply the tests;

## How to run the tests

* There are two ways of testing the code;
* I eased the testing with simple `make` commands:
  * testing with go: `make go-test`
  * testing with docker: `make docker-test`

> Notes:
>
> * Testing with docker takes longer due to download and build time;
> * Neither of the test commands verifies if the needed programs are properly installed;

## Test output sample
